                    Google is my best friend and my worst enemy. It's fabulous for research, but then it becomes
                    addictive. I'll have a character eating an orange, and next thing I'm Googling types of oranges, I'm visiting
                    chat rooms about oranges, I'm learning the history of the orange.

                    It's usually a jolly good trick to pick up a local tour guide. They can tell you all the anecdotes
                    that make a place interesting. I'm one for rushing off to museums at the crack of dawn, eating
                    fabulous things on terraces for lunch, and enjoying long dinners on balmy evenings.

                    For me, getting older doesn't mean throwing away a favourite-coloured lipstick or a fabulous pair
                    of boots; instead, it's about harnessing all the great things I have learnt over the years about what does
                    and doesn't suit me, and enjoying the way in which cleverly selected outfits can enhance the nice bits.

                    Space exploration promised us alien life, lucrative planetary mining, and fabulous lunar colonies.
                    News flash, ladies and gents: Space is nearly empty. It's a sterile vacuum, filled mostly with the
                    junk we put up there.

                    From this day on, when I look back on the past, I will smile and say to myself "I never thought I could do it.. But I did..
                    I overcome all the people who tried to bring me down.

                    I guess some people are brilliant enough to be brilliant on their own and never doubt anything and come
                    up with fabulous things. But I think it's good to get into arguments with people and have them say, 'That sucks'
                    or 'You're crazy' or 'That's cheesy' or 'What do you think of this?'

                    Onions and bacon cooking up just makes your kitchen smell so good. In fact, one day I'm going
                    to come up with a room deodorizer that smells like bacon and onions. It's a fabulous smell.

                    I was bullied and picked on because I was so different to everyone else, and I definitely didn't believe or even
                    know I was fabulous back then. But those hard times made me everything
                    I am today. It's all water under the bridge now, but being bullied and going through adversity definitely made me stronger.

                    Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen
                    all at once.
